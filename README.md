BROWSER-BASED GAME PROJECT

Simon Says, Bop-it!

Pressing Start initializes the first round- watch the selected color button, then respond by clicking the same color, which will initialize the next round with a second color, the next will have a third, etc. 

Each round will play the sequence + new color, to which you must respond with the same sequence. If you repeat the sequence wrong, you lose and must **START OVER**.

Complete 20 rounds to win and become a champion!

I present Simon gameplay with Bop-it sound effects & color theme for a fun throwback combo. A mashup of call & repeat games that I remember from childhood. I love the nostalgia trend of the 90's with the first electronic games because that's what I grew up with!

Stretch Goals:
* sharpen the timeouts and disabling of player functions when it's not the player turn
* create a rapid flashing button interval to celebrate winning the last round
* add more audio banter sound effects to cycle through when you lose
