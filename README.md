Simon Says - Bopit!

A mashup of simple call & repeat games that I remember from childhood- they are simple yet require you to stay focused, and you can play endlessly by yourself. I love the nostalgia trend of the 90's because I grew up in that era with the first electronic games! I present Simon gameplay with Bopit colors and sound effects for a fun throwback combo.

-sharpen the timeouts and disabling of player functions when it's not the player turn
-create a rapid flashing button interval to celebrate winning the last round
-add more audio banter sound effects to cycle through when you lose
