Simon Says - Bopit!

A mashup of call & repeat games that I remember from childhood. I love the nostalgia trend of the 90's with the first electronic games because that's what I grew up with! I present Simon gameplay with Bopit colors and sound effects for a fun throwback combo.

Stretch Goals:
-sharpen the timeouts and disabling of player functions when it's not the player turn
-create a rapid flashing button interval to celebrate winning the last round
-add more audio banter sound effects to cycle through when you lose
